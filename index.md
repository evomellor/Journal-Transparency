The TOP Guidelines provide a common framework for evaluating how journals, publishers, and funding agencies reward transparency and rigor over novelty. Transparency Scores increase visibility of journal policies as a mechanism for promoting valued research practices, promote journals with strong policies for promoting openness and reproducibility, and provide an alternative metric to the Impact Factor that evaluates journal process and policies. The purpose of the Transparency Score is to improve alignment of scientific values with scientific practices.
